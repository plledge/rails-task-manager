# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# puts "Add fake tasks"

# 20.times do |gen|
#   Task.create(
#     title: faker
#     details:
#     completed: [true, false].sample
#   )
# end
